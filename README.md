# IsabelaFunctions
IsabelaFunctions, as the name suggests, contains the functions I developed for my Master's project, as well as functions implemented for further analysis and visualization of the Martian magnetic field environment.

## Requirements
IsabelaFunctions requires Python version 3.6 or higher. 

Some functions might require certain packages to be installed. You can find all of the required packages' names in 'environment.yml'.

## Installation
If you would like to install the IsabelaFunctions's package, clone the project to create a local working copy:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IsabelaFunctions.git
```

## Documentation
Read the documentation for each function. The functions are classified in six main groups, according to their purpose:

### 1. read
Reads IDL-generated files, e.g., files created in CCATi.

### 2. mapsetup
Useful for the visualization of maps.

### 3. fieldmodel
Computes the crustal magnetic field components from Langlais' spherical harmonic model at a certain altitude.

### 4. shifting
Functions useful for the shifting technique/investigation of the advection of the crustal magnetic field.

### 5. fit
Computes different types of fits/regression for the data.

### 6. orbits
Useful for the analysis and visualization of individual datapoints.
